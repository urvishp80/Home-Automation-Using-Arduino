# Home-Automation-Using-Arduino
It is simple home automation project using arduino uno micro-controller.
Following is the part list that I have used in this project.
 1. Arduino Uno
 2. Relays (5V DC, 220V AC) ,2 pieces
 3. PIR motion 
 4. Bluetooth module
 5. Jumper wire
 6. Android App (Created by me)
 
 
You ca find the connection of pins and sensors in code as it is well commented code.
Also you can download the app from here. 
Using the android app our mobile send command to arduino via bluetooth and then arduino turn on the fan or light as per command. As I have said it is simple project so, it does not contain any hard code and methods. You can find parts and some sample code related to it on GOOGLE.
